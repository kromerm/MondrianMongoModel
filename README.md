Hi! Thanks for downloading ...

If you want to just go right ahead and give this a shot, go to the "dist" folder.

I put a shell script for Linux and a batch file for Windows in that folder that will launch the app from the executable jar file.

Obviously, you will need a local JVM on whatever machine you use to run this program.

Best, Mark
